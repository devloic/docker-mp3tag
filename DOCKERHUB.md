MKVcleaver is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for mkvtoolnix, designed to extract
data from MKV files. It can be used in a batch mode (loading and extracting data
from many files) as well as single file mode. It has a simple GUI interface, but a
lot of functionality.

## Quick Start

**NOTE**: The Docker command provided in this quick start is given as an example
and parameters should be adjusted to your need.

Launch the MKVCleaver docker container with the following command:
```shell
docker run -d \
    --name=mkvcleaver \
    -p 5800:5800 \
    -v /docker/appdata/mkvcleaver:/config:rw \
    -v /home/user:/storage:rw \
    jlesage/mkvcleaver
```

Where:
  - `/docker/appdata/mkvcleaver`: This is where the application stores its configuration, states, log and any files needing persistency.
  - `/home/user`: This location contains files from your host that need to be accessible to the application.

Browse to `http://your-host-ip:5800` to access the MKVCleaver GUI.
Files from the host appear under the `/storage` folder in the container.
